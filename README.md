### Spring Meta-Annotation showcase

Very simple showcase on how to use meta-annotations (composed annotations) in spring to avoid
having same multiple annotations over and over again in codebase.

To verify it's working you only have to build it. Tests will print out everything needed to console.

### How to build the project?

```
git clone https://github.com/jbellmann/spring-events-showcase.git
cd spring-events-showcase
./build.sh
```
